# Functions in Rust and JavaScript for flows.network1

![badge](https://github.com/second-state/flow-functions/workflows/build/badge.svg?style=flat-square)

## Introduction

This repo consists of many functions to automate your workflows across multiple SaaS with the [flows.network](https://flows.network/) platform. 

Since flows.network is programmable, you could write code to transform data between two SaaS based on your business needs as a developer.

The flow functions could be written in Rust and JavaScript.


## Usage

Please refer to our [Get Started](https://docs.flows.network/docs/category/getting-started) guide to automating workflows with the functions.

The following table shows the usage of each package. Remember to select the corresponding inbound and outbound connectors on the [flows.network](https://flows.network/) platform.
